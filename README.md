## Aspiring Software Developer

### About me

Hi, I'm Warwick, an aspiring software developer ready to be challenged.

I am currently working through project 4 of my full stack developer diploma. I have always loved computing and coding but I am now pushing myself to actually dedicate my life to it.

When I am not coding you may find me playing video games, and more now then ever I appreciated the dedication and hard work that goes in to making them. Even when surfing the web now, stuff that we end-users took for granted I know the hours of pain and suffering that went in to making that button work.
